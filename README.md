A vanilla exemplar of a "Todo list" application with AngularJS supported by Django Rest Framework API at the back-end.

To try out:
1. Make venv with requirements.txt packages installed
2. Clone repo and go in project root
3. Run "python manage.py runserver"
4. Navigate to "http://localhost:8000/todo/welcome/"

Thank you!
